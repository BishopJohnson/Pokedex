      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        This app is intended to demonstrate my ability as a full stack developer
        <br />
        and someone who can develop on Google Cloud Platform. However, this app
        <br />
        is not intended to demonstrate my ability to design a front-end's aesthetic,
        <br />
        since I am not knowledgeable with such principles.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Pokemon?</h4>
      <p>
        I decided to create a pokemon based app mainly due to my love of the
        <br />
        games and franchise.
      </p>
